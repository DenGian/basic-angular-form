## What are front-end frameworks?

To understand a Front end framework, we need to know what the front-end is.  
The front-end of a website or application is the stuff visible to the user on the website.  
The graphics, typography, and arrangement of these two are what contribute.  
In addition, it includes building user-friendly interfaces and efficiently presenting the data from the back end to a user.

Thus, a Front-end Framework is a platform/tool to build the front end of your website.  
Some tasks one can perform using a Front-end Framework are â€“ the management of AJAX requests, associating data with The Document object Model (DOM) elements, defining a file structure, and styling of components on the website or application.
